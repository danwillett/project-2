# Controllers

## Homepage Routes
What data do we need retrieve from the backend and send to front end for handlebars to eventually display:
- we want to get user preferences so when they search, 
- Yelp API requests

## User Routes
What do we need to get, update, or post to backend?
- We already have login and logout routes
- We need a post route to create an account
    - after generating an account we need to redirect to the survey and create a new survey page/post route that will save user data in the db.
