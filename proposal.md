# Restaurant Roulette

## User Story:

As a hungry person who can’t decide where to eat out,
I want an application that will suggest a restaurant matching my preferences to go to.

## Acceptance Criteria:

Given a CMS-style mobile website,

When I visit the site for the first time,
Then I am presented with a login/create account screen.
Then I fill out a questionnaire with the following:
- Minimum star ratings
- dietary preferences.

When I am logged in and taken to the homepage,
Then I am shown the last recommended restaurant.

When I click the random restaurant button,
Then I am presented a list optional filters such as:
- Price 
- Location/distance
- Cuisines
When I have dietary change or whatever,
Then I click on my profile icon and have an option to edit the profile and relog the questionnaire.

When I don’t want to be recommended a restaurant,
Then I can click a thumbs-down icon and prevent the app from recommending the restaurant again.
