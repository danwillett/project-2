# Restaurant Roulette

## Description

This application enables users to pick a restaurant to eat at given user preferences such as location and cuisine. We made this project because we often struggle to decide on what to eat in a group setting. Removing the decision-making process behind this frequent conundrum would help reduce arguments between friends and family.

Just navigate to this website, create a profile and fill out your preferences, then begin finding restaurants!

## Usage

When first navigating to our site, you will be prompted to either login or create a new account. If you are a first time user, choose the option to create a new account and fill out a questionnaire of your eating and location preferences. These preferences will help us refine our search results to best cater your needs. You can always change these when searching for restaurants!

Once you have logged in or created your new account, you will be taken to the homepage where you can type in various cuisines into the search field. A list of suggestions will autopopulate. Select the cuisine you are in the mood for then add your next filter.

When you have added in your desired cuisine filters you can press the "Find Restaurants" button and our application will recommend a restaurant and provide some details. If you decide you would like to remove a filter, simply click the cuisine tag you would like to remove. If you are in a different location than the location you specified in the questionnaire, click the location tag and fill out the form with your new city and state.
